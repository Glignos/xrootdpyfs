XRootDPyFS is a PyFilesystem interface to XRootD.

XRootD protocol aims at giving high performance, scalable fault tolerant access
to data repositories of many kinds. The XRootDPyFS adds a high-level interface
on top of the existing Python interface (pyxrootd) and makes it easy to e.g.
copy a directory in parallel or recursively remove a directory.
